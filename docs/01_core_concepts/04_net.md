## NET as resource

As CPU and RAM, NET is also a very important resource in EOSIO-based blockchains. NET is the network bandwidth measured in bytes of transactions and it is referred to as `net bandwidth` on the cleos get account command. This resource like CPU must be staked so that a contract's transactions can be executed.
